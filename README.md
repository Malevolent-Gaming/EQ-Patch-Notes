Update notes for EverQuest: Planes of Malevolence


TEST NOTES

Update 0.2.1
Several of these changes were requested features in #💡swg-suggestions channel on Discord. I highly encourage everyone to submit suggestions that would make for a better player experience!

General Changes
Changed auction and vendor timers as well as vendor idle timers to 365 days.
Increased bazaar listing timer to 365 days
Increased bazaar listing limit to 100 per player
(You will need to repost items in order to gain the new 365 day timer - Reported by Zoe)

Crafting Changes
Increased *ALL *component factory crates to stack to 1000 as well as some final crafted items like food
All resources have had their Min stat increased to 50% of that Max that resource stat can be.
(Example: future resources with a max of 1000 OQ will spawn between 500 and 1000 OQ instead of 1 to 1000.)

Increased resource quality talent from 1% per point, to 5% per point which will bring in a total of 20% increased resource quality.
(Will require update to client for expertise info to display correctly. This client change will come later)
